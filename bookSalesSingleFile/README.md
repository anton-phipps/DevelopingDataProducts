## Sales Profit Maximizer

Imagine this scenario, you are selling books on a pay as you wish model for a first edition book. You
would like to use the voluntary payments to decide what price point you should use to sell your second
edition book.

Making the assumption that the voulountary prices will follow a gamma distribution, enter the real values
and the application will return the price which will maximize the profit. That is to say, it will maximize
the sale price and the percentage of people that are estimated to be willing to pay that price or more.

You can also enter a specific price and see what percentage of customers would theoretically be willing
to pay that price or more.

### Methodology

Let us say that if we offer the product for $0.00 then 100 percent of people would be willing to pay
that amount, but the profit would be zero if 100 people buy the book.

In a second example, say 60% of people would be willing to pay $20 or more. Then for each 100 people who
consider buying the product, you will have 60 sales, and thus a profit of $1200.

If with this same distribution, you have 50% of people who are willing to pay $30 or more, then the profit
will be $1500 at that price point.

As you can see, if you match a distribution, there will exist an optimal price point for which will can
be established statistically.

It should be noted, for the purpose of optimzation, values less or equal to 0 will be set to $ 0.01.
